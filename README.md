# QGEN
QGEN is a cutting-edge project with a bold vision and mission to revolutionize exam cells in colleges. Our aim is to automate the entire process of generating question papers in a computerized way, making examinations more efficient and streamlined.
-Devised QGEN, an automated system generating question papers in seconds with minimal effort.
-Enabled faculty to customize content, modules, and difficulty, reducing prep time by 70%.
-Streamlined paper generation, cutting resource allocation by 60%.
-Developed using Java, Servlet, and SQL

In simpler terms, we took what we learned about building websites with Java and turned it into a practical project.

We harnessed a range of technologies to bring our project to life, including:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for crafting an interactive user interface
- Java with DBUtil, OJDBC, and Servlet API for robust backend development
- Oracle SQL for efficient and structured data management
- Tomcat server for seamless deployment and testing
