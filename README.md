# QGEN
QGEN is a cutting-edge project with a bold vision and mission to revolutionize exam cells in colleges.

**Simplifying Knowledge into Practical Innovation**

Our journey began with transforming Java-based web development concepts into real-world application. Leveraging an array of technologies, we breathed life into our project:

- Crafted interactive UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Engineered robust backend using Java, DBUtil, OJDBC, and Servlet API.
- Employed Oracle SQL for efficient data management.
- Ensured seamless deployment and testing via Tomcat server.
